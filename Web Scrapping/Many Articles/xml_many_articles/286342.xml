      <title>Background</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is a common, severe, and persistent mental illness. This condition is a serious lifelong struggle and challenge.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc1" name="refsrc1"/>1] </sup>Other mental disorders and general medical conditions are more prevalent in patients with bipolar disorders than in patients in the general population.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc5" name="refsrc5"/>5] </sup>Among the general comorbid conditions, cardiometabolic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity are a common source of morbidity and mortality for persons with bipolar disorder. </para>
        <para>Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of deep, prolonged, and profound <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286759-overview">depression</a> that alternate with periods of an excessively elevated or irritable mood known as mania. This pattern of alternating severe depression and periods of mania is characteristic of bipolar disorder type I (BPI), although in rarer cases, persons may only experience episodes of mania. In practice, symptoms of mania and depression can also occur together in what is termed a mixed state as the illness evolves. By contrast, bipolar disorder type II (BPII) is diagnosed when episodes of severe depression are punctuated with periods of hypomania, a less severe form of mania that does not include psychosis or lead to gross impairment in functioning. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is given to individuals with periods of both hypomanic and depressive symptoms without meeting the full criteria for mania, hypomania or major depression. </para>
        <para>The symptoms of mania include decreased sleep time accompanied by a decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, increased libido, reckless behavior without regard for consequences, grandiosity, and severe thought disturbances, which may or may not include psychosis. Between these highs and lows, many patients, if adequately medicated, usually experience periods of higher functionality and can lead a productive life. </para>
        <para>Unipolar (major depressive) disorder and bipolar disorder share depressive symptoms, but bipolar disorder is defined by episodes of mania or hypomania. A community lifetime prevalence of 4% for BPI and BPII disorder combined has been suggested. The costs of bipolar disorder include the direct costs of treatment along with the even more significant indirect costs of excess unemployment, decreased productivity, and excess mortality; it is a severely impairing illness that affects many aspects of patients' lives.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc6" name="refsrc6"/>6] </sup></para>
        <para>In the 5th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, (<em>DSM-5</em>), bipolar disorder constitutes a spectrum of mood disorders that includes BPI, BPII, cyclothymiaand are thought to be a “bridge” between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and depressive disorders in terms of the symptomology, family history and genetics.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc2" name="refsrc2"/>2] </sup></para>

      <title>Pathophysiology</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>The pathophysiology of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has not been determined, and no objective biologic markers correspond definitively with the disease state. However, twin, family, and adoption studies all indicate that bipolar disorder has a significant genetic component. In fact, first-degree relatives of a person with bipolar disorder are approximately 7 times more likely to develop bipolar disorder than the rest of the population, and the heritability of bipolar I disorder (BPI) has recently been estimated at 0.73.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc7" name="refsrc7"/>7] </sup></para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Genetics</title>
        <para>The genetic component of bipolar disorder appears to be complex: The condition is likely to be caused by multiple different common disease alleles, each of which contributes a relatively low degree of risk on its own. Such disease genes can be difficult to find without very large sample sizes, on the order of thousands of subjects. </para>
        <para>When the genetics of bipolar disorder were first being studied, less precise tools were available, but they still yielded interesting information. Many loci are now known to be associated with the development of bipolar disorder. These loci are grouped as major affective disorder (MAFD) loci and numbered in the order of their discovery. </para>

        <para><em>MAFD1</em> is located at 18p and was originally described in a group of 22 patients with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc8" name="refsrc8"/>8] </sup><em>MAFD2</em> is located at Xq28 and, as such, is associated with an X-linked inheritance pattern. The notion of an X-linked form of bipolar disorder is not a new one, and at least one paper from the pregenetic era discusses this very possibility.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc9" name="refsrc9"/>9] </sup><em>MAFD3</em> is located at 21q22.13, and the association appears to be with the <em>TRPM2</em> gene.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc10" name="refsrc10"/>10, <ref_inline id="refsrc11" name="refsrc11"/>11] </sup><em>MAFD4</em> is located at 16p12 and has been associated with susceptibility to bipolar disease in a cohort of 41 Finnish families.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc12" name="refsrc12"/>12] </sup></para>
        <para><em>MAFD5</em> is located at 2q22-q24, and <em>MAFD6</em> is located at 6q23-24. Interestingly, evidence suggests a strong interaction between genes located in these 2 regions. It has been concluded that the candidate gene in the <em>MAFD5</em> locus shows epistatic interaction with the <em>MAFD6</em> risk locus.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc13" name="refsrc13"/>13] </sup><em>MAFD7</em> is located at 22q12.1 and was detected using microsatellite markers in a North American population; a large region on 22q12 was associated with bipolar disorder in this study.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc14" name="refsrc14"/>14] </sup>Further study in this region showed a polymorphism in the promoter region of the <em>XBP1</em> gene, which also showed susceptibility to bipolar disorder in a Japanese cohort.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc15" name="refsrc15"/>15] </sup><em>XBP1</em> appears to be involved mainly in immune system function; thus,its influence on the susceptibility of bipolar disorder is not understood. </para>
        <para><em>MAFD8</em> is located at 10q21, and its discovery is the result of a large analysis of over 1.8 million variants in 4387 cases of bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16] </sup>The association in this study appears to be with the <em>ANK3</em> gene, which is a gene of marked interest and is therefore discussed at length below.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16] </sup><em>MAFD9</em> is located at 12p13.3, and its discovery is the result of the same large analysis as <em>MAFD8</em>. The association in this study appears to be with the <em>CACNA1C</em> gene.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16] </sup>Like <em>ANK3</em>, it remains a gene of interest<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc17" name="refsrc17"/>17] </sup>and is also mentioned below. </para>
        <para>
          <em>Genome-wide association studies</em>
        </para>
        <para>The first series of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for bipolar disorder were published in 2007 and 2008,<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc18" name="refsrc18"/>18, <ref_inline id="refsrc19" name="refsrc19"/>19, <ref_inline id="refsrc20" name="refsrc20"/>20, <ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16] </sup>and a collaborative analysis of the last 3 studies gave combined support for 2 particular genes, <em>ANK3</em> (ankyrin G) and <em>CACNA1C</em> (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) in a sample of 4387 cases and 6209 controls.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16] </sup><em>ANK3</em> is an adaptor protein found at axon initial segments that regulates the assembly of voltage-gated sodium channels. Both <em>ANK3</em> and subunits of the calcium channel are downregulated in mouse brain in response to lithium, which indicates a possible therapeutic mechanism of action of one of the most effective treatments for bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc21" name="refsrc21"/>21] </sup></para>
        <para>Further evidence for association of bipolar disorder to <em>CACNA1C</em> was reported in 2011 in an ever-growing sample (numbering 11,974 bipolar disorder cases and 51,792 controls at the time of the report), providing overwhelming support for this gene as a bipolar susceptibility locus.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc17" name="refsrc17"/>17] </sup></para>
        <para><em>CACNA1C,</em> on chromosome 12, encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channel found in the brain. L-type calcium channel blockers have been used to treat bipolar disorder, and there has been speculation that at least some mood stabilizers may mediate their effects via modulating calcium channel signaling in bipolar illness. </para>
        <para>A joint analysis of the bipolar GWAS data was carried out, including GWAS data from another large-scale study of schizophrenia published in the same issue. Again, both <em>ANK3</em> and <em>CACNA1C</em> came up positive in the combined data set, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these disorders. A previous National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on GWASs also underscored that bipolar disorder and <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/288259-overview">schizophrenia</a> could indeed share common susceptibility genes on chromosome 6.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc22" name="refsrc22"/>22] </sup>These data herald future revision of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision,</em> (<em>DSM-IV-TR</em>) according to an etiologic rather than descriptive basis. </para>
        <para>In 2013, the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium published results of their large GWAS study of psychiatric disorders, reporting that specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with range of childhood- or adult-onset psychiatric disorders.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc23" name="refsrc23"/>23] </sup>The study comprised a combined sample of 33,332 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, attention deficit disorder and autism spectrum disorders and 27,888 controls of European ancestry.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc23" name="refsrc23"/>23] </sup></para>
        <para>Specific expression of common genetic variants at different times during development, or in different regions of the brain, and in concert with other genetic variants could help to explain differences in disease phenotypes. Genetic markers in 4 regions were associated with all 5 disorders, including variants in the <em>CACNA1C</em> gene, another gene for an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunit, <em>CACNB2</em>, and markers on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc23" name="refsrc23"/>23] </sup>Although specific variants from <em>CACNA1C</em> showed the strongest association when only samples from individuals with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia were evaluated, the majority of regions seemed to be associated with all 5 disorders, suggesting that common risk alleles contribute to each phenotype, an effect described as pleiotropy. As noted by the authors, although <em>CACNB2</em> was not identified in previous GWASs of a combined bipolar and schizophrenia sample, it was one of the main signals detected in an independentGWASs of Han Chinese individuals with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc23" name="refsrc23"/>23] </sup></para>
        <para>Although the first GWAS of bipolar disorder used a much smaller sample size than subsequent attempts, including an initial sample of 461 patients with bipolar disorder from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) consortium and a follow-up sample of 563 patients collected in Germany, it still yielded interesting observations that will need to be followed up in the larger samples mentioned earlier.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc18" name="refsrc18"/>18] </sup>For example, the strongest association signals were detected in genes also involved in biochemical pathways regulated by lithium. The strongest hit was at a marker within the first intron of diacylglycerol kinase eta (<em>DGKH</em>) gene. <em>DGKH</em> is a key protein in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway. </para>
        <para>Three of the other associated genes in this study also interact with the Wnt signaling pathway upstream and downstream of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β). Lithium-mediated inhibition of GSK3β is thought to result in downregulation of molecules involved in cell death and upregulation of neuroprotective factors. </para>
        <para>Additionally, GSK3β is a central regulator of the circadian clock, and lithium-mediated modulation of circadian periodicity is thought to be a critical component of lithium’s therapeutic effect. In fact, another major coup for bipolar disorder research has been the finding that a dominant-negative mutation in the <em>CLOCK</em> gene normally contributing to circadian periodicity in humans results in maniclike behavior in mice,<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc24" name="refsrc24"/>24] </sup>including hyperactivity, decreased sleep, reduced anxiety, and an increased response to cocaine. The latter finding also provides a shared biologic basis for the high rate of substance abuse observed in clinical populations of subjects with bipolar disorder. </para>
        <para>Furthermore, the experimenters were able to abolish the manic behaviors by rescuing expression of normal <em>CLOCK</em> specifically in the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc25" name="refsrc25"/>25] </sup>This area is rich in D2 receptors. Joseph Coyle hypothesized in his commentary in the paper on the same issue that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in acute mania might, in part, be achieved by their ability to lower activity in neurons specifically within the ventral tegmental area.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc26" name="refsrc26"/>26] </sup></para>
        <para>Although large-scale association studies of bipolar disorder are beginning to yield results, one of the greatest obstacles to finding genes for such complex behavior is the imprecision inherent in diagnosis of the disorder itself; objective criteria are lacking. Therefore, some of the most exciting recent research is focused on defining heritable, quantitative diagnostic measures that capture specific features of bipolar disorder (termed endophenotypes) to refine the search for responsible genes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc27" name="refsrc27"/>27] </sup>Such promising measures for bipolar disorder include structural brain phenotypes, sleep and activity measures, neurocognitive measures, and gene expression studies.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc28" name="refsrc28"/>28] </sup>This collaborative research effort under the aegis of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has been termed the Bipolar Phenome Project.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc29" name="refsrc29"/>29] </sup></para>
        <para>Newer GWASs continue to find additional genes of interest which appear to be associated with an increased risk of bipolar disorder. One study showed an association between bipolar disorder and the <em>NCAN</em> gene.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc30" name="refsrc30"/>30] </sup>This gene is expressed in the brain and is involved in the migration of cells within the brain. In a mouse model, it was observed that the <em>NCAN</em> product is most prevalent in the hippocampus. There was no phenotypic defect in <em>NCAN</em> -deficient mice, but subtle effects could not be excluded.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc30" name="refsrc30"/>30] </sup></para>
        <para>Although most of the present research does not stratify by sex, a recent study looked at association between estrogen receptor binding site variation with bipolar disorder in females. In particular, the association is with the <em>transglutaminase 2</em> (<em>TGM2</em>) gene, which is known to be under estrogenic control.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc31" name="refsrc31"/>31] </sup>This is further evidence of the heterogeneity of bipolar disorder and also presents evidence to explain the differences in the epidemiology of bipolar disorder between women and men.</para>
        <para>Of additional interest, a number of studies suggest that certain large copy number variants (greater than 100 kb) (includes both deletions and duplications) are associated with psychiatric disease, with bipolar disease and schizophrenia being the most commonly associated.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc32" name="refsrc32"/>32] </sup>The implication is that possession of one of these copy number variants may modify the phenotype to those who are at risk of psychiatric disease.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc32" name="refsrc32"/>32] </sup></para>
        <para>When investigators looked at microarray results for 1001 patients with bipolar disorder and 1033 controls to quantify the risk of deletions throughout the genome for patients with bipolar disorder, they found that 16.2% of patients with bipolar disorder had deletions, whereas 12.3% of controls had deletions. In addition, patients who had bipolar disorder and deletions more frequently had onset of mania before age 18 years.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc4" name="refsrc4"/>4] </sup></para>
        <para>
          <em>Gene expression studies</em>
        </para>
        <para>Gene expression studies are one way of measuring the relative activity or inactivity of genes, and they have already been proven useful for illuminating the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder. For example, studies comparing specific regions of postmortem brain tissue from persons with bipolar disorder with tissue from control subjects have consistently shown that levels of expression of oligodendrocyte-myelin–related genes appear to be decreased in brain tissue from persons with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc33" name="refsrc33"/>33, <ref_inline id="refsrc34" name="refsrc34"/>34, <ref_inline id="refsrc35" name="refsrc35"/>35, <ref_inline id="refsrc36" name="refsrc36"/>36] </sup>As with genetic studies, gene expression profiling studies require very large sample sizes to produce replicable data. Furthermore, they must focus on the correct brain region(s) thought to be functioning differently in bipolar disorder, a point still under some debate. Therefore, research in this area is ongoing and frequently subject to update. </para>
        <para>Oligodendrocytes produce myelin membranes that wrap around and insulate axons to permit the efficient conduction of nerve impulses in the brain. Therefore, loss of myelin is thought to disrupt communication between neurons, leading to some of the thought disturbances observed in bipolar disorder and related illnesses. Brain imaging studies of persons with bipolar disorder also show abnormal myelination in several brain regions associated with this illness.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc37" name="refsrc37"/>37, <ref_inline id="refsrc38" name="refsrc38"/>38] </sup>It can be useful to compare data from gene expression studies with brain imaging studies of persons with bipolar disorder to determine whether abnormalities of structure or function correlate with changes in gene expression. In this case, structural neuroimaging studies also show abnormal myelination in several brain regions associated with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc37" name="refsrc37"/>37, <ref_inline id="refsrc38" name="refsrc38"/>38] </sup>Of note, many widely used psychotropic treatments including those for bipolar disorder share signaling pathways that affect myelination, its plasticity, andrepair;such pathways may promote myelination of neurons.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc39" name="refsrc39"/>39] </sup></para>
        <para>Interestingly, gene expression and neuroimaging studies of persons with schizophrenia and major depression also demonstrate similar findings, indicating that mood disorders and schizophrenia may share some biologic underpinnings, possibly related to psychosis. These types of data may also lead to the future revision of psychiatric diagnostic manuals based on a new understanding of the etiology of these disorders. </para>
        <para>Another approach to delineating the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder involves studying changes in gene expression induced in rodent brains after administration of pharmacologic agents used to treat bipolar disorder. For example, investigators have demonstrated that 2 chemically unrelated drugs (lithium and valproate) used to treat bipolar disorder both upregulate the expression of the cytoprotective protein Bcl-2 in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of rat brains.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc40" name="refsrc40"/>40] </sup>These types of studies are also performed on human tissue by exposing cultured monocytes from peripheral blood to lithium and other factors. </para>
        <para>A postmortem study by Konradi et al of the hippocampus in both patients with bipolar disorder and healthy persons found that the 2 groups did not differ in the total number of hippocampal neurons.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc41" name="refsrc41"/>41] </sup>However, patients with bipolar disorder had reduced volume of nonpyramidal cell layers, a reduced number of somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin positive neurons, a reduced somal volume in cornu ammonis sector 2/3, and reduced messenger RNA levels for somatostatin, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 1. These findings suggest alteration of hippocampal interneurons in patients with bipolar disorder that might lead to hippocampal dysfunction. </para>
        <para>Neuroimaging studies of individuals with bipolar disorder or other mood disorders also suggest evidence of cell loss or atrophy in these same brain regions. Thus, another suggested cause of bipolar disorder is damage to cells in the critical brain circuitry that regulates emotion. According to this hypothesis, mood stabilizers and antidepressants are thought to alter mood by stimulating cell survival pathways and increasing levels of neurotrophic factors to improve cellular resiliency. In 2008, Mathew et al published a review of novel drugs and therapeutic targets for severe mood disorders that focus on increasing neuroplasticity and cellular resiliency.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc42" name="refsrc42"/>42] </sup></para>
        <para>Post et al had previously proposed a mechanism involving electrophysiologic kindling and behavioral sensitization processes, which resonates with the neuronal injury hypothesis.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc24" name="refsrc24"/>24] </sup>They asserted that a person who is susceptible to bipolar disorder experiences an increasing number of minor neurologic insults—such as those induced by drugs of abuse, stress-related excessive glucocorticoid stimulation, oxidative or immune-mediated damage—that eventually resulting in mania that further compromises the injured neurons.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc24" name="refsrc24"/>24] </sup>Sufficient brain damage might persist to cause mania to recur even with no or minor environmental or behavioral stressors. </para>
        <para>Post et al’s formulation helps explain the effective role of anticonvulsant medications (eg, carbamazepine and valproate) in the prevention of the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. It also supports clinical observations that the more episodes a person experiences, the more he or she will have in the future, underscoring the need for long-term treatment. </para>

        <title>Genetic factors</title>
        <para>Bipolar disorder, especially bipolar type I (BPI) disorder, has a major genetic component, with the involvement of the <em>ANK3,</em><em>CACNA1C,</em> and <em>CLOCK</em> genes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc18" name="refsrc18"/>18, <ref_inline id="refsrc19" name="refsrc19"/>19, <ref_inline id="refsrc20" name="refsrc20"/>20, <ref_inline id="refsrc16" name="refsrc16"/>16, <ref_inline id="refsrc17" name="refsrc17"/>17, <ref_inline id="refsrc25" name="refsrc25"/>25, <ref_inline id="refsrc43" name="refsrc43"/>43] </sup>The evidence indicating a genetic role in bipolar disorder takes several forms. </para>
        <para>First-degree relatives of people with BPI are approximately 7 times more likely to develop BPI than the general population. Remarkably, offspring of a parent with bipolar disorder have a 50% chance of having another major psychiatric disorder. One logitudinal study found that subthreshold manic or hypomanic episodes were a diagnostic risk factor for the development of subsequent manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes in the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. High-risk offspring, compared with offspring of parents without bipolar disorder, also had higher rates of ADHD, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc44" name="refsrc44"/>44] </sup></para>
        <para>Twin studies demonstrate a concordance of 33-90% for BPI in identical twins. As identical twins share 100% of their DNA, these studies also show that environmental factors are involved, and there is no guarantee that a person will develop bipolar disorder, even if they carry susceptibility genes.</para>
        <para>Adoption studies prove that a common environment is not the only factor that makes bipolar disorder occur in families. Children whose biologic parents have either BPI or a major depressive disorder remain at increased risk of developing an affective disorder, even if they are reared in a home with adopted parents who are not affected. Frey and colleagues’ work supports the genetic contributions in bipolar affective disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc45" name="refsrc45"/>45, <ref_inline id="refsrc46" name="refsrc46"/>46] </sup></para>
        <para>Using probands from the Maudsley Twin Register in London, Cardno and colleagues showed that schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and manic syndromes share genetic risk factors and that the genetic liability was the same for <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/294763-overview">schizoaffective disorder</a> as for the other 2 syndromes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc47" name="refsrc47"/>47] </sup>This finding suggests an independent genetic liability for psychosis shared by both mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, as Berrettini<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc48" name="refsrc48"/>48] </sup>previously speculated and that has been confirmed in the recent large-scale GWAS studies mentioned above.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc17" name="refsrc17"/>17] </sup></para>
        <para>Gene expression studies also demonstrate that persons with bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia share similar decreases in the expression of oligodendrocyte-myelin-related genes and abnormalities of white matter in various brain regions. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Biochemical factors</title>
        <para>Multiple biochemical pathways likely contribute to bipolar disorder, which is why detecting one particular abnormality is difficult. A number of neurotransmitters have been linked to this disorder, largely based on patients’ responses to psychoactive agents as in the following examples. </para>
        <para>The blood pressure drug reserpine, which depletes catecholamines from nerve terminals, was noted incidentally to cause depression. This led to the catecholamine hypothesis, which holds that an increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine causes mania and a decrease in epinephrine and norepinephrine causes depression. </para>
        <para>Drugs used to treat depression and drugs of abuse (eg, cocaine) that increase levels of monoamines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, can all potentially trigger mania, implicating all of these neurotransmitters in its etiology. Other agents that exacerbate mania include L-dopa, which implicates dopamine and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, which in turn implicate serotonin. </para>
        <para>Evidence is mounting of the contribution of glutamate to both bipolar disorder and major depression. A postmortem study of the frontal lobes of individuals with these disorders revealed that the glutamate levels were increased.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc49" name="refsrc49"/>49] </sup></para>
        <para>Calcium channel blockers have been used to treat mania, which may also result from a disruption of intracellular calcium regulation in neurons as suggested by experimental and genetic data. The proposed disruption of calcium regulation may be caused by various neurologic insults, such as excessive glutaminergic transmission or ischemia. Interestingly, valproate specifically upregulates expression of a calcium chaperone protein, GRP 78, which may be one of its chief mechanisms of cellular protection. </para>
        <para>Hormonal imbalances and disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in homeostasis and the stress response may also contribute to the clinical picture of bipolar disorder. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Neurophysiologic factors</title>
        <para>In addition to structural neuroimaging studies that look for volumetric changes in brain regions regardless of brain activity, functional neuroimaging studies are performed to find regions of the brain, or specific cortical networks, that are either hypoactive or hyperactive in a particular illness. For example a meta-analysis by Houenou et al found decreased activation and diminution of gray matter in a cortical-cognitive brain network, which has been associated with the regulation of emotions in patients with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc50" name="refsrc50"/>50] </sup>An increased activation in ventral limbic brain regions that mediate the experience of emotions and generation of emotional responses was also discovered. This provides evidence for functional and anatomic alterations in bipolar disorder in brain networks associated with the experience and regulation of emotions.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc50" name="refsrc50"/>50] </sup></para>

        <title>Psychodynamic factors</title>
        <para>Many practitioners see the dynamics of manic-depressive illness as being linked through a single common pathway. They see the depression as the manifestation of losses (ie, the loss of self-esteem and the sense of worthlessness). Therefore, the mania serves as a defense against the feelings of depression. Melanie Klein was one of the major proponents of this formulation. </para>
        <para>A study by Barnett et al found that personality disturbances in extraversion, neuroticism, and openness are often noted in patients with bipolar disorder and may be enduring characteristics.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc51" name="refsrc51"/>51] </sup></para>

      <pgroup>
        <title>Environmental factors</title>
        <para>In some instances, the cycle may be directly linked to external stresses or the external pressures may serve to exacerbate some underlying genetic or biochemical predisposition. For example, pregnancy is a particular stress for women with a manic-depressive illness history and increases the possibility of postpartum psychosis.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc52" name="refsrc52"/>52] </sup></para>
        <para>Because of the nature of their work, certain individuals have periods of high demands followed by periods of few requirements. For example, a landscaper and gardener who was busy in the spring, summer, and fall became relatively inactive during the winter, except for plowing snow. Consequently, he appeared manic for a good part of the year, and then he would crash and hibernate during the cold months. </para>

        <para>BPI occurs equally in both sexes; however, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (≥4 episodes/y) is more common in women than in men. The incidence of BPII is higher in females than in males. Most studies report a nearly equal male-to-female ratio in the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, most studies also report an increased risk in women for BPII/hypomania, rapid cycling, and mixed episodes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc57" name="refsrc57"/>57] </sup></para>

      <title>Prognosis</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has significant morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, during the early part of the 1990s, the cost of lost productivity resulting from this disorder was estimated at approximately $15.5 billion annually. Approximately 25-50% of individuals with bipolar disorder attempt suicide, and 11% successfully commit suicide.</para>
        <para>Additionally, a 2011 study from the United Kingdom suggested that for patients with bipolar disorder, mortality 1 year after hospital discharge was also higher than that of the general population for natural causes, chiefly respiratory and circulatory disorders.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc58" name="refsrc58"/>58] </sup></para>
        <para>Patients with BPI fare worse than patients with a major depression. Within the first 2 years after the initial episode, 40-50% of these patients experience another manic attack. Only 50-60% of patients with BPI who are on lithium gain control of their symptoms. In 7% of these patients, symptoms do not recur, 45% of patients experience more episodes, and 40% go on to have a persistent disorder. Often, the cycling between depression and mania accelerates with age. </para>

        <para>The mixed symptomatology is quite common in patients presenting with bipolar symptomatology. This often causes a diagnostic dilemma<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc62" name="refsrc62"/>62] </sup>and has prompted a revision to the definition of bipolar disorder in <em>DSM-5.</em> With the aim of capturing mixed symptoms more effectively, the “mixed episode” diagnosis has been eliminated in favor of a “mixed features specifier” that could be added to any mood bipolar disorder diagnosis.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc63" name="refsrc63"/>63] </sup>Other specifiers include anxious distress, rapid cycling, mood-congruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset and seasonal pattern.</para>
        <para>Of interest, when investigating bipolar mixed states, Swann and colleagues concluded that although controversy exists regarding the definitions and properties of mixed states, the concept of mixed states and their characteristics over a range of clinical definitions and diagnostic methods has remained consistent.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc64" name="refsrc64"/>64] </sup>Moreover, “distinct characteristics related to the course of illness emerge at relatively modest opposite polarity symptom levels in depressive or manic episodes.”<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc64" name="refsrc64"/>64] </sup></para>

        <title>Appearance</title>
        <para>Persons experiencing a depressed episode may demonstrate poor to no eye contact. Their clothes may be unkempt, unclean, holed, unironed, and ill-fitting. If the person has lost significant weight, the garments may fit loosely. </para>
        <para>The personal hygiene of individuals experiencing a depressed episode reflects their low mood, as evidenced by poor grooming, lack of shaving, and lack of washing. In women, fingernails may show different layers of polish or one layer partially removed, and they may not have paid attention to their hair. Men may exhibit dirty fingernails and hands. When these individuals move, their depressed affect is demonstrated: They move slowly and very little; they show psychomotor retardation; they may talk in low tones or in a depressed or monotone voice. </para>
        <para>Persons experiencing a hypomanic episode are busy, active, and involved. They have energy and are always on the go. They are always planning and doing things. Others notice their energy levels and mood changes. </para>
        <para>In many ways, the behavior of a patient in the manic phase is the opposite of that of a person in the depressed phase. Patients experiencing the manic phase are hyperactive and might be hypervigilant. They are restless, energized, and active. They talk and act fast. Their attire also reflects the mania: Their clothes might have been put on in haste and are disorganized. Alternately, their garments are often too bright, colorful, or garish. These individuals stand out in a crowd, because their dress frequently attracts attention. </para>

        <para>In persons experiencing a manic episode, the mood is inappropriately joyous, elated, and jubilant. These individuals are euphoric. They also may demonstrate annoyance and irritability, especially if the mania has been present for a significant length of time. </para>

      <pgroup>
        <title>Thought content</title>
        <para>Patients experiencing a depressed episode have thoughts that reflect their sadness. They are preoccupied with negative ideas and nihilistic concerns, and they tend to "see the glass as half empty." They are likely to focus on death and morbid persons, and many think about suicide. </para>
        <para>Patients experiencing a hypomanic episode are optimistic, forward thinking, and have a positive attitude.</para>
        <para>Patients experiencing a manic episode have very expansive and optimistic thinking. They may be excessively self-confident or grandiose, often have a very rapid production of ideas and thoughts, perceive their minds as being very active, and see themselves as being highly engaging and creative. These individuals are highly distractible and quickly shift from one person to another. </para>
        <para>Patients experiencing a mixed episode can oscillate dramatically between depression and euphoria, and they often demonstrate marked irritability. </para>

      <pgroup>
        <title>Perceptions</title>
        <para>Two forms of a major depression are described, one with psychotic features and the other without. With psychosis, the patient experiences delusions and hallucinations that are either consistent or inconsistent with the mood. The patient’s delusions of having sinned are accompanied by guilt and remorse, or the patient feels he or she is utterly worthless and should live in total deprivation and degradation. Hence, the delusional content remains consistent with the depressed mood. Some patients experience delusions that are inconsistent with the depression, such as paranoia or persecutory delusions. </para>
        <para>By definition, patients experiencing a hypomanic episode do not experience hallucinations, although milder manic syndromes may be accompanied by such symptoms. </para>
        <para>Approximately three fourths of patients experiencing a manic episode have delusions. As in major depression, the delusional content is either consistent or inconsistent with the mania. Manic delusions reflect perceptions of power, prestige, position, self-worth, and glory. </para>
        <para>Patients experiencing a mixed episode might exhibit delusions and hallucinations consistent with either depression or mania or congruent to both. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Suicide/self-destruction</title>
        <para>Patients experiencing a depressed episode have a very high rate of suicide. They are the individuals who attempt and succeed at killing themselves. Query patients to determine if they have any thoughts of hurting themselves (suicidal ideation) and any plans to do so. The more specific the plan, the higher the danger. </para>
        <para>Dubovsky has reported that the highest lifetime suicide risk (17.08%) is in men with bipolar disorder and deliberate self-harm.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc66" name="refsrc66"/>66] </sup>Similarly, in a European study of adults with bipolar disorder, Bellivier and colleagues found that 29.9% had a history of at least 1 attempt of suicide (663 of 2219 patients who provided data on lifetime history of suicide attempts).<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc67" name="refsrc67"/>67] </sup>However, female sex, history of alcohol abuse, history of substance abuse, young age at first treatment for a mood episode, longer disease duration, greater depressive symptom severity (5-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-5] total score), current benzodiazepine use, higher overall symptom severity (Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder [CGI-BP] scale: mania and overall score), and poor compliance were the baseline factors associated with a history of suicidal behavior.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc67" name="refsrc67"/>67] </sup></para>
        <para>As patients emerge from a period of depression, their suicide risk may increase. This may be because, as the illness remits, executive functions are improved to the point where the person is again capable of making and carrying out a plan while the subjective feeling of depression and accompanying suicidal thoughts persist. </para>
        <para>Patients experiencing a hypomanic or manic episode have a low incidence of suicide. In mixed episodes, the depressed phases put the patient at risk for suicide. </para>

        <title>Homicide/violence/aggression</title>
        <para>In patients experiencing a depressed episode, suicide generally remains the paramount issue. However, certain persons in the depths of a depression see the world as hopeless and helpless not only for themselves but also for others. Frequently, that perspective can create and lead to a homicide followed by a suicide. </para>
        <para>For example, a 42-year-old mother of 2 was experiencing a significant depression as part of her bipolar disorder. She believed the earth was doomed and was a terrible place to dwell. Furthermore, she thought that if she died, her children would be left in a wretched place. Because of this view, she planned to kill her 2 children and then herself. Fortunately, her family recognized the state of affairs, which led to an emergency intervention and her hospitalization. </para>
        <para>Patients who are hypomanic frequently show evidence of irritability and aggressiveness. They can be pushy and impatient with others. </para>
        <para>Persons experiencing a manic episode can be openly combative and aggressive. They have no patience or tolerance for others, and they can be highly demanding, violently assertive, and highly irritable. The homicidal element is particularly likely to emerge if these individuals have a delusional content to their mania. These individuals act out of the grandiose belief that others must obey their commands, wishes, and directives. They may become violent toward those who do not comply with their demands. For example, a patient believing oneself to be a king will command others to fully, completely, and immediately follow his commands. The lack of compliance may make the patient violent.If the delusions become persecutory in nature, he may defend himself against others in a homicidal fashion. </para>
        <para>Persons experiencing a mixed episode may exhibit aggression, especially in the manic phases.</para>
        <para>Volavka reported that, relative to the general population, there has been a statistically significant increase in the risk of violence in individuals with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc68" name="refsrc68"/>68] </sup>Moreover, the evidence suggests that the risk of violence is greater in those with bipolar disorder (particularly during the manic phase) than in those with schizophrenia.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc68" name="refsrc68"/>68] </sup>The risk of violence in both conditions is further increased by comorbid substance use disorder. </para>

        <title>Judgment/insight</title>
        <para>In persons experiencing a depressive episode, the depression clouds and dims their judgment and colors their insights. They fail to make important plans/actions, because they are so down and preoccupied with their own plight. These individuals see no tomorrow; therefore, planning for it is difficult. Frequently, persons in the middle of a depression have done things such as forgetting to pay their income taxes. At that time, they have little insight into their behavior. Often, others have to persuade them to seek therapy because of their lack of insight. </para>
        <para>Persons experiencing a hypomanic episode generally act expansively and may demonstrate poor judgment by taking on too many tasks or becoming overinvolved. Often, their distractibility impairs their judgment, and they have little insight into their driven qualities. They see themselves as productive and conscientious, not as hypomanic. </para>
        <para>In patients experiencing a manic episode, judgment is seriously impaired. These persons make terrible decisions in their work and family. For example, they may invest the family fortune in very questionable programs, become professionally overinvolved in work activities or with coworkers, or start dramatically unsound fiscal or professional ventures. These individuals ignore feedback, suggestions, and advice from friends, family, and colleagues. They have no insight into the extreme nature of their demands, plans, and behavior. Often, commitment proves the only way to contain them. </para>
        <para>In persons experiencing a mixed episode, major shifts in affect during short lengths of time severely impair their judgment and interfere with their insight. </para>

        <title>Cognition</title>
        <para>Impairments in orientation and memory are seldom observed in patients with bipolar disorder unless they are very psychotic. They know the time and their location, and they recognize people. They can remember immediate, recent, and distant events. In some cases of hypomanic and even manic episodes, their ability to recall information can be extremely vivid and expanded. However, later in the course of their illness, their cognition becomes impaired. In extremes of depression and mania, these individuals may experience difficulty in concentrating and focusing. Similar to subcortical dementia, depression impairs cognition. </para>

      <title>Approach Considerations</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>A number of reasons exist for obtaining selected laboratory studies in patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). An extensive range of tests is indicated, because bipolar disorder encompasses both depression and mania and because a significant number of medical causes for each state exists. The basic principle remains, "Do not miss a treatable medical cause for the mental status." </para>
        <para>Second, the condition necessitates use of a number of medications that require certain body systems to be working properly. For example, lithium requires an intact genitourinary (GU) system and can affect certain other systems, and certain anticonvulsants can suppress bone marrow. </para>
        <para>Third, because bipolar illness is a lifelong disorder, performing certain baseline studies is important to establish any long-term effects of the medications. </para>
        <para>A number of infections, especially chronic infections, can produce a presentation of depression in the patient. An encephalitis can dramatically manifest as changes in mental status and, in rare situations, present with bipolar features. </para>

    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="c8">
      <title>Blood Studies</title>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Complete blood count</title>
        <para>A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is used to rule out anemia as a cause of depression in bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). Treatment, especially with certain anticonvulsants, may depress the bone marrow—hence the need to check the red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts for signs of bone marrow suppression. </para>
        <para>Lithium may cause a reversible increase in the WBC count.</para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</title>
        <para>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is determined to look for any underlying disease process such a lupus or an infection. An elevated ESR often indicates an underlying disease process. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Fasting glucose</title>
        <para>In some cases, a fasting glucose level is indicated to rule out diabetes. In addition, atypical antipsychotics have been associated with weight gain and problems with blood glucose regulation in patients with diabetes, therefore, a baseline fasting glucose should be obtained. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Electrolytes</title>
        <para>Serum electrolyte concentrations are measured to help diagnose electrolyte problems, especially with sodium, that are related to depression. Treatment with lithium can lead to renal problems and electrolyte problems, and low sodium levels can lead to higher lithium levels and lithium toxicity. Hence, in screening candidates for lithium therapy as well as those on lithium therapy, checking electrolytes is indicated. </para>
        <para>Serum calcium is assessed to diagnose hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia associated with mental status changes (eg, hyperparathyroidism). An elevated calcium blood level can cause depression or mania. Hyperparathyroidism, as evidenced by an elevated calcium blood level, produces depression. Certain antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, affect the heart; therefore, checking calcium levels is important. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Proteins</title>
        <para>Low serum protein levels found in patients who are depressed may be a result of not eating. Such low levels increase the availability of certain medications, because these drugs have less protein to which to bind. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Thyroid hormones</title>
        <para>Thyroid tests are performed to rule out hyperthyroidism (mania) and hypothyroidism (depression). Treatment with lithium can cause hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism may cause rapid cycling of mood, especially in women. </para>
        <para>In a study to assess the relationship between bipolar affective disorder and thyroid dysfunction, Krishna et al found that elevated T3 hormone had a statistically significantly association with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc71" name="refsrc71"/>71] </sup>In fact, patients with bipolar disorder were 2.55 times more commonly associated with thyroid dysfunction than individuals without bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc71" name="refsrc71"/>71] </sup></para>

      <pgroup>
        <title>Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen</title>
        <para>Kidney failure can present as depression. Treatment with lithium can affect urinary clearances, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels can increase; however, other signs and symptoms of kidney failure will appear first. Carefully and regularly monitor renal function. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Liver and lipid panel</title>
        <para>Antipsychotics agents have also been associated with changes in patients’ lipid profiles, potentially resulting in dyslipidemia (eg, hypertriglyceridemia), as well as liver damage/dysfunction. </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Other laboratory tests</title>
        <para>Although not a routine screening test in bipolar disorder and unnecessary in patients with normal liver function test results, urine copper level testing may be performed to rule out Wilson disease, which produces mental changes. Wilson disease is a rare condition that is easily missed. </para>
        <para>Antinuclear antibody testing is used to rule out lupus.</para>
        <para>Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be helpful. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) causes changes in mental status, including dementia and depression. </para>
        <para>Obtaining a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test may be indicated in selected patients. Syphilis, especially in its later stage, alters mental status. </para>

      <title>Substance and Alcohol Screening</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Alcohol abuse and abuse of a wide variety of drugs can present as either mania or depression. For example, speed (ie, amphetamines) and cocaine abuse can present as a manialike disorder, and barbiturate abuse can present as a depressionlike disorder.</para>
        <para>A number of patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), also have a drug or alcohol addiction; that is, they have dual diagnoses. Indeed, relative to other mental illnesses, individuals with bipolar disorder have a disproportionately high rate of substance use disorders, a co-occurrence that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc72" name="refsrc72"/>72] </sup></para>

      <pgroup>
        <para>Always evaluate patients with mania, hypomania, or mixed episode, and those with bipolar depression, for suicidality, acute or chronic psychosis, or other unstable or dangerous conditions.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup></para>
        <para>The treatment of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is directly related to the phase of the episode (ie, depression or mania) and the severity of that phase. For example, a person who is extremely depressed and exhibits suicidal behavior requires inpatient treatment. In contrast, an individual with a moderate depression who still can work would be treated as an outpatient. Fortunately, most patients recover from the first manic episode, but their course beyond that is variable.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc73" name="refsrc73"/>73] </sup></para>
        <para>It is important to determine whether current medications may be causing the patient’s manic, hypomanic, or mixed manic episode. In such patients, discontinue antidepressants or other mania-inducing agents. However, antidepressants known to have associated discontinuation syndromes should be tapered over several weeks.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup></para>
        <para>Evaluate and closely monitor patients with bipolar depression for the risk for mood destabilization or switching to mania and for the presence of emergent symptoms following initiation of pharmacotherapy for a depressive episode.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup>Initiate an antipsychotic agent in patients with bipolar depression with psychotic features, and consider psychosocial interventions (eg, psychoeducation; psychotherapy strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], interpersonal and social rhythm therapy [IPSRT], family focused therapy; chronic care model-based interventions).</para>
        <para>The patient’s response to treatment may depend on the number of previous episodes of bipolar disorder. In a report that analyzed pooled data, the importance of early intervention was demonstrated with better treatment responses in individuals who had earlier stages of illness.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc74" name="refsrc74"/>74] </sup>Bipolar patients who experienced fewer previous mania episodes (1-5) displayed a twofold increase in the treatment response rate to olanzapine relative to those who had already experienced more than 5 previous episodes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc74" name="refsrc74"/>74] </sup>In patients with depression, the response rates were also significantly higher in patients with fewer episodes, although the findings were only for 2 of the measured responses. In the maintenance studies, groups with fewer previous episodes (1-5 or 6-10) experienced a 40-60% reduction in the risk of relapse to either mania or depression compared to the group that had more than 10 previous episodes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc74" name="refsrc74"/>74] </sup></para>
        <para>If the patient is in a short-term inpatient care unit and has not made significant progress, reevaluate the management strategy. Transfer to a long-term inpatient care unit might also be considered. If the patient is in a depressed or manic phase and is not responding to medications, transfer the patient to a facility where electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be administered. Additionally, consultation with a psychiatric colleague or a psychopharmacologist is always appropriate if the patient does not respond to conventional treatment and medication. </para>
        <para>All patients with bipolar disorder need outpatient monitoring for both medications and psychotherapy. In addition, these individuals need education regarding their condition. The schedule must be regular, with great flexibility if they need extra sessions.</para>
        <para>The 2010 Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder recommends reassessing patients who start treatment for acute bipolar mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes every 1-2 weeks for at least 6 weeks.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup>Patients with severe mania who are not hospitalized should be reassessed every 2-5 days until symptoms improve. An absence of any significant symptoms of mania or depression for 2 months should be considered to be full remission and assessment of symptoms should then be continued periodically to monitor for relapse.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup></para>

        <para>A patient with bipolar disorder, especially one in a depressive episode, may present with a significant risk for suicide, especially those with an early onset of symptoms.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc75" name="refsrc75"/>75] </sup>Serious suicide attempts and specific ideation with plans constitute clear evidence of the need for constant observation and preventive protection; consider referring these individuals to mental health specialty care.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup>Occasionally, depression is so profound that the person cannot function at all; thus, the danger to the person may come from other aspects of the disease. For example, a person in extreme mania who foregoes sleep or food may be in a state of serious exhaustion. Leaving such a person alone would be dangerous and not therapeutic. </para>
        <para>Goldstein and associates followed the mental health of 413 youths diagnosed with bipolar disorders and found that 76 (18%) attempted suicide at least once within 5 years of study; of these youths, 31 (8% of the overall group and 41% of those who attempted suicide) made many attempts.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc75" name="refsrc75"/>75] </sup>The investigators concluded that bipolar disorder with early onset is associated with high suicide attempt rates. Therefore, the patient’s severity of depression at presentation and their family history of depression must be considered when evaluating youths with bipolar disorder and their suicide risk.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc75" name="refsrc75"/>75] </sup></para>
        <para>Patients with bipolar disorder can also become a threat to others. For example, a patient experiencing a severe depression believed the world was so bleak that she planned to kill her children to spare them from the world’s misery. </para>
        <para>Sometimes, patient’s behaviors are totally out of control, which is a particular concern during a manic episode. In this situation, patients’ behaviors are so beyond limits that they destroy their career and can be harmful to those around them. For example, a delusional patient having a manic episode believed everyone was against him; he searched for a rifle in order to defend himself and to “get them” before they “got” him. </para>
        <para>Some patients with bipolar disorder have other medical conditions for which medication monitoring is warranted. For example, patients with certain cardiac conditions should be in a medical environment where the effects of the psychotropic medications can be monitored and observed closely. </para>
        <para>In the clearest case of the bipolar/depressed phase, the patient is suicidal and homicidal in a few situations (this can result in homicide followed by suicide). In these scenarios, institutioinal commitment is in order and indicated. In other situations, the depression has led to an inability of the patient to work, eat, and function; hospitalization is also indicated in these cases. </para>
        <para>In the situation of a patient in the bipolar/manic phase, although the patient does not show clear and dramatic evidence of homicide or suicide, a pattern of very poor judgment and impairment emerges. Because of their behavior during the manic phase, the person often does major damage to their finances, career, and position in the community. This type of self-destructive mania calls for containment with good documentation and family support. </para>

      <title>Considerations for Partial Hospitalization or Day Treatment</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>In general, patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), who are candidates for partial hospitalization or day treatment experience severe symptoms but have some level of control and a stable living environment. For example, a patient with severe depression who has thoughts of suicide but no plans to act upon them and who has a high degree of motivation can get well when given a great deal of interpersonal support, especially during the day, and with the help of a very involved and supportive family. The family needs to be home every night and should be very concerned with the patient’s care. </para>
        <para>Partial hospitalization also offers a bridge to return to work. Returning directly to work is often difficult for patients with severe symptoms, and partial hospitalization provides support and interpersonal relationships. </para>

        <para>Outpatient treatment for patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has 4 major goals, as follows: </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Look at areas of stress and find ways to handle them: The stresses can stem from family or work, but if they accumulate, they propel the person into mania or depression; this is a form of psychotherapy </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Monitor and support the medication: Medications make an incredible difference, and the key is to obtain the benefits while avoiding adverse effects; patients are ambivalent about their medications—although they recognize that the drugs help and prevent hospitalizations, they also resent that they need them; the goal is to address their feelings and allow them to continue with the medications </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Develop and maintain the therapeutic alliance: This is one of the many reasons for the practitioner to deal with the patient’s ambivalence about the medications; over time, the strength of the alliance helps keep the patient’s symptoms at a minimum and helps the patient remain in the community </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Provide education (see Patient Education): The clinician must help educate both the patient and the family about bipolar illness; patients and families need to be aware of the dangers of substance abuse, the situations that would lead to relapse, and the essential role of medications; support groups for patients and families are of tremendous importance </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Psychotherapy helps patients with bipolar disorder but does not cure the disorder by itself. When Schottle and colleagues looked at psychotherapy for patients, family, and caregivers, they found that although results were heterogeneous, most studies demonstrated relevant positive results in regard to decreased relapse rates, improved quality of life, increased functioning, or more favorable symptom improvement.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc4" name="refsrc4"/>4] </sup></para>
        <para>Somatic health issues in individuals with bipolar disorder are ubiquitous, underrecognized, and suboptimally treated.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc76" name="refsrc76"/>76] </sup>Therefore, practitioners must pay attention to patient’s medical conditions, including cardiovascular concerns, diabetes, endocrine problems, infections, urinary complications, and electrolyte imbalances. In view of the possible medical complications, medical follow-up is important. Persons with bipolar disorder often have difficulty obtaining primary physician care.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc77" name="refsrc77"/>77] </sup></para>
        <para>Patients with chronic medical illnesses and depression should be treated with a comprehensive approach involving the patient, the family, the support team, the physician, other professionals, and community resources. Such models, called Collaborative Chronic Care Models (CCMs), have been developed to improve outcomes in chronically ill patients treated in the primary care setting who also suffer from depression. CCMs were defined a priori as interventions with at least 3 of the 6 components of the Improving Chronic Illness Care initiative, as follows: </para>

      <title>Pharmacologic Therapy</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Appropriate medication depends on the stage of the bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), the patient is experiencing. Thus, a number of drugs are indicated for an acute manic episode, primarily the antipsychotic agents, valproate, and benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, clonazepam). The choice of agent depends on the presence of symptoms such as psychotic symptoms, agitation, aggression, and sleep disturbance. (See the list of medications for bipolar disorder in Table 1, below.) For patients with bipolar affective disorder in the depressed phase, the Medscape Reference article <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286759-overview">Depression</a> provides antidepressant guidelines. </para>

        <para>Bauer and colleagues have suggested 2 approaches to treatment options in bipolar patients.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc80" name="refsrc80"/>80] </sup>First, in a patient with bipolar depression who is not currently being treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (de novo depression, first or subsequent episode), options include quetiapine or olanzapine, with carbamazepine and lamotrigine as alternatives.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc80" name="refsrc80"/>80] </sup>Antidepressants are options for short-term use, but it remains controversial as to whether it is better to administer them in combination with mood-stabilizing agents or as monotherapy. Second, if the patient is already optimally treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (appropriate dose, good compliance) such as lithium, an option would be lamotrigine. No evidence suggests additional benefit from antidepressants if a patient is already being treated with a mood stabilizer, but this often tried in practice.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc80" name="refsrc80"/>80] </sup></para>
        <para>One cautionary note of interest: Post and colleagues found that the more different antidepressant trials the patient with bipolar disorder has received, the less responsive they become to treatment.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc81" name="refsrc81"/>81] </sup></para>

        <para>A study by Bauer et al suggested that lithium may also have a neuroprotective role.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc84" name="refsrc84"/>84] </sup>However, this agent is also associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. The consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism should prompt physicians to check patient calcium concentrations before and during treatment. Lithium is not associated with a significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc85" name="refsrc85"/>85] </sup></para>
        <para>Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being used for the treatment of both acute mania and mood stabilization. The broad range of antidepressants and ECT are used for an acute depressive episode (ie, major depression). However, ECT may also be considered for patients with severe mania or treatment-resistant mania, those who prefer ECT, and pregnant women with severe mania.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup>Ansari and Osser developed a very useful algorithm for the Harvard South Shore Program to treat a bipolar patient in a depressed phase through “an organized, sequential, and evidence-supported approach.”<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc86" name="refsrc86"/>86] </sup>Finally, another set of medications is chosen for the maintenance and preventive phases of treatment. </para>
        <para>Diazgranados and colleagues reported that for patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression, impressive and swift antidepressant effects occurred when a single intravenous (IV) dose of the <em>N</em> -methyl-<em>D</em> -aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine was administered.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc87" name="refsrc87"/>87] </sup>Increasingly, the role of glutamate in mood disorders is being researched, and experimental evidence shows that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine may be helpful in short-term treatment of depression, even in the context of bipolar disorder. However, it is important to note that the benefit of such treatment disappeared after 4 days. </para>
        <para>Although antidepressant medications are most often prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing an acute depression, a study found that antidepressants were not statistically superior to placebo or other current standard treatment for bipolar depression.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc88" name="refsrc88"/>88] </sup></para>
        <para>Clinical experiences have shown that patients with bipolar disorder have fewer episodes of mania and depression when treated with mood-stabilizing drugs.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc89" name="refsrc89"/>89] </sup>These medications not only serve to stabilize the patient’s mood, as the name implies, they can also dampen extremes of mania or depression. Kessing et al found that, in general, lithium was superior to valproate.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc90" name="refsrc90"/>90] </sup></para>
        <para>Atypical antipsychotics (including ziprasidone, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and asenapine) are also now frequently used to stabilize acute mania—or even to treat bipolar depression in some cases. </para>

The APA’s 2005 guideline watch for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder considered both lamotrigine and lithium to have substantial utility in the maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc53" name="refsrc53"/>53] </sup></para>
        <para>Popovic et al suggested the use of a Polarity Index to guide the choice of maintenance therapy in bipolar patients.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc93" name="refsrc93"/>93] </sup>Based on results from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, the investigators indicated that this index may provide a measure of the relative preventive antimanic versus antidepressive efficacy of drugs that are used to treat bipolar disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc93" name="refsrc93"/>93] </sup>They defined a Polarity Index value greater than 1.0 as having a relative greater antimanic prophylactic efficacy, whereas a value less than 1.0 would have a relative greater antidepressive efficacy.

A 2012 study suggested that lithium may also have a neuroprotective role.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc81" name="refsrc81"/>81] </sup>However, this agent is also associated with an increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. The consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism should prompt physicians to check patient calcium concentrations before and during treatment. </para>
        <para>Lithium is not associated with a significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc84" name="refsrc84"/>84] </sup>Lithium therapy may serve to protect and preserve the hippocampal volumes, in contrast to patients with major depression (ie, unipolar), who show diminished hippocampal volumes.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc85" name="refsrc85"/>85] </sup></para>

        <para>Anticonvulsants have been effective in preventing mood swings associated with bipolar disorder, especially in those patients known as rapid cyclers. For the depressed phase, mood stabilizers, such as lithium and lamotrigine, are preferred, because antidepressants may propel a patient into a manic episode or exacerbate irritability in mixed-symptom mania. Gabapentin, although not a mood stabilizer, also may have anxiolytic properties.The most widely used anticonvulsants have been carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine. More recently, topiramate and oxcarbazepine also are being tried.</para>
