      <pgroup>
        <para>Several biologic theories are postulated for the pathogenesis of phobic disorders, most focusing on the dysregulation of endogenous biogenic amines. Sympathetic nervous system activation is common in phobic disorders, resulting in elevations in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, sweating, dyspnea, dizziness, and paresthesias.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc2" name="refsrc2"/>2] </sup></para>
        <para>Psychological theories range from explaining anxiety as a displacement of an intrapsychic conflict (psychodynamic models) to conditioning (learned) paradigms (cognitive-behavior models). Many of these theories capture portions of the disorder. </para>
        <para>A psychoanalyst would likely conceptualize social anxiety as a symptom of a deeper conflict—for instance, low self-esteem or unresolved conflicts with internal objects. The treatment uses exploration with the goal of understanding the underlying conflict. </para>
        <para>A behaviorist would see phobia as a learned, conditioned response resulting from a past association with a situation that had negative emotional valence at the time of association (eg, social situations are avoided because intense anxiety was originally experienced in that setting). Even if no danger is posed in most social encounters, an avoidance response has been linked to these situations. Treatment from this perspective aims to weaken and eventually separate the specific response from the stimulus. </para>
        <para>Genetic factors seem to play a role in both social anxiety disorder (social phobia) and specific phobia.

        <para>Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown lower serotonin (5-HT) 1A binding in the amygdala and mesiofrontal areas, and negative correlations between cortisol plasma levels and 5-HT1A binding in the amygdala, hippocampus, and retrosplenial cortex have been reported in patients with social anxiety disorder.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc10" name="refsrc10"/>10, <ref_inline id="refsrc11" name="refsrc11"/>11] </sup></para>

        <para>A PET study showed that the phobic response in spider phobia (SpP) and snake phobia (SnP) phobia increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right amygdala, the cerebellum, and the left visual cortex but reduced rCBF in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, ventromedial, primary somatosensory cortex, as well as auditory cortices.

        <para>Because anxiety manifests with a number of physical symptoms, any patient who presents with a de novo complaint of physical symptoms suggestive of an anxiety disorder should undergo a physical examination to help rule out medical conditions that might present with anxietylike symptoms (see Differentials). If a patient presents for a repeat visit with similar complaints, after medical contributors have been ruled out, a careful <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/293402-overview">mental status examination</a> might be preferable to repeat physical examination and laboratory investigations. </para>
        <para>When considering anxiety as the primary suspect, the physician should always remember that over time, patients with anxiety are just as likely to develop medical conditions as other patients are. Accordingly, a diagnosis of anxiety, though changing the threshold for investigation of physical symptoms, should not keep the patient from receiving regular follow-up examinations as otherwise indicated. </para>
        <para>More than 75% of patients with blood-injection-injury type phobia report a history of fainting in situations where they are presented with a trigger. Initial increases in heart rate and blood pressure are followed by decreases in both parameters, resulting in fainting. This physiologic response differs from the typical response seen in other phobias, in which exposure is followed by increased heart rate and blood pressure.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc1" name="refsrc1"/>1] </sup></para>

        <title>Mental status examination</title>
        <para>The physician should assess the patient’s appearance, behavior, ability to cooperate with the examination, level of activity, speech, mood and affect, thought processes and content, insight, and judgment. </para>
        <para>In a situation where the patient is abruptly confronted with the object of his or her phobia, his or her mental status examination will be significant for an anxious affect, with a restricted range. Neurovegetative signs (eg, tremor or diaphoresis) may be present. The patient also reports feeling anxious (mood) and can clearly identify the reason for his/her anxiety (thought content). The thought content is significant for phobic ideation (unrealistic and out-of-proportion fears). </para>
        <para>Insight may be impaired, especially during exposure, but in most cases, insight is preserved. Although patients still report that they cannot control their feelings, they also acknowledge that the severity of their fears is not justified. </para>
        <para>At any other time, the mental status of a patient with phobic disorder is within normal limits, except for thought content positive for phobic ideation. These phobic ideas may remain undisclosed unless specific questions about phobias are asked. Phobic disorders themselves do not present with suicidal or homicidal ideation, but comorbid conditions commonly associated with them (eg, depression and other anxiety disorders) often do. If comorbid conditions exist, the suicidal and homicidal risk should also be specifically assessed. </para>

        <para>If left untreated, social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia can result in tremendous morbidity. The patient becomes restricted to the most familiar surroundings (eg, a house) or the most trusted people (eg, a family member or spouse), and his or her ability to work and relate to other people is substantially impaired. In addition, there is a considerable risk of substance abuse with this degree of isolation,<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc33" name="refsrc33"/>33] </sup>and social anxiety disorder has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent depression.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc34" name="refsrc34"/>34] </sup></para>

In addition, high placebo response rates have been documented across a range of anxiety disorders.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc37" name="refsrc37"/>37] </sup>Accordingly, when an anxiety disorder is mild (ie, not associated with disability), a wait-and-see, supportive type of intervention is recommended. </para>

        <para>In October 2003, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding reports of suicidality in pediatric patients being treated with antidepressant medications for major depressive disorder. This advisory reported suicidality (both ideation and attempts) in clinical trials of various antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients.

        <para>SSRIs can help prevent panic attacks and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. These drugs may require 2-6 weeks of daily use to become effective, usually with side effects appearing first. SSRIs have been shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials, and as a class, these medications tend to have the fewest adverse effects. However, the SSRIs can produce drug-drug interactions by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes and by displacing other drugs from protein-binding sites.</para>
        <para>SSRIs are greatly preferred to other classes of antidepressants for the treatment of anxiety disorders, and they all appear to be similarly efficacious. The choice of an SSRI depends on adverse effects, drug interactions, and history of previous response.</para>
        <para>The relatively benign adverse effect profile of SSRIs (including minimal anticholinergic effects) facilitates compliance. Common adverse effects include insomnia, ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay), nausea, sweating, fatigue, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction.

        <title>Pregabalin (Lyrica)</title>
        <para>Pregabalin is a structural derivative of GABA. Its mechanism of action is unknown. It binds with high affinity to alpha-2-delta calcium channel subunits. In vitro, it reduces the calcium-dependent release of several neurotransmitters, possibly by modulating calcium channel function.</para>

        <title>Valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Stavzor)</title>
        <para>The mechanism of action of valproic acid is not established; its activity may be related to increased brain levels of GABA or enhanced GABA action. Valproic acid may also potentiate postsynaptic GABA responses, affect the potassium channel, or exert a direct membrane-stabilizing effect.</para>
