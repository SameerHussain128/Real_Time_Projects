        <para>Esophageal cancer is a disease in epidemiologic transition. Until the 1970s, the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States was squamous cell carcinoma, which has smoking and alcohol consumption as risk factors; since then, there has been a progressive increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, for which the most common predisposing factor is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). See the image below.</para>

      <title>Background</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Esophageal cancer is a devastating disease. Although some patients can be cured, the treatment for esophageal cancer is protracted, diminishes quality of life, and is lethal in a significant number of cases. </para>
        <para>The principal histologic types of esophageal cancer are <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1965430-overview">squamous cell carcinoma</a> and adenocarcinoma. As squamous cells line the entire esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma can occur in any part of the esophagus; it often arises, however, in the upper half of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma typically develops in specialized intestinal metaplasia (Barrett metaplasia) that develops as a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); thus, adenocarcinoma typically arises in the lower half of the distal esophagus. (See Pathophysiology and Etiology.) </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Diagnosis</title>
        <para>The most common presenting symptom of esophageal cancer is dysphagia (see Presentation). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsies of the tumor, while endoscopic ultrasonography is the most sensitive test for determining the depth of penetration of the tumor and the presence of enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes. In patients who appear to have localized esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be useful as part of the baseline staging. Other imaging studies may be valuable in selected patients. (See Workup.) </para>
      </pgroup>
      <pgroup>
        <title>Treatment</title>
        <para>Surgery has traditionally been the treatment for esophageal carcinoma. The first successful resection was performed in 1913 by Torek.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc3" name="refsrc3"/>3] </sup>In the 1930s, Ohsawa in Japan and Marshall in the United States were the first to perform successful single-stage transthoracic <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1965556-overview">esophagectomies</a> with continent reconstruction.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc4" name="refsrc4"/>4, <ref_inline id="refsrc5" name="refsrc5"/>5] </sup>Nonoperative therapy is usually reserved for patients who are not candidates for surgery because of clinical conditions or advanced disease. (See Treatment.) </para>
        <para>The ideal treatment for localized esophageal cancer is sometimes debated across practice cultures and subspecialties. Defendants of surgical treatment argue that resection is the only treatment modality to offer curative intent; defendants of the nonsurgical approach claim that esophagectomy has a prohibitive index of mortality and that esophageal cancer is an incurable disease. </para>

These include peptic strictures from gastroesophageal reflux and benign esophageal tumors (principally <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/174599-overview">esophageal leiomyoma</a>).

In Western cultures, retrospective evidence has implicated cigarette smoking and chronic alcohol exposure as the most common etiologic factors for squamous cell carcinoma.

A complaint of dysphagia in an adult should always prompt an endoscopy to help rule out the presence of esophageal cancer. A barium swallow study is also indicated in these cases. </para>

      <title>Staging</title>
      <pgroup>
        <para>Esophageal cancer staging follows the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification of the American Joint Cancer Committee/Union for International Cancer Control/ (AJCC/UICC). The classification and staging scheme was changed in the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC manual, published in 2010.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc33" name="refsrc33"/>33] </sup></para>
        <para>No completely satisfactory method is available to clinically stage esophageal cancer. The difficulty of clinically assessing the disease is reflected by changes over time in the AJCC staging system. The 1983 system was based on the length of the intraluminal esophageal tumor, the presence of esophageal obstruction, and the involvement of palpable lymph nodes. This clinical staging system proved to be limited.</para>
        <para>The 1988 revision defined a clinical and pathologic staging system based entirely on the depth of esophageal wall invasion and the presence or absence of local nodal involvement. Neither of these parameters is assessed easily on a clinical basis. Hofstetter et al therefore proposed incorporating the number of involved lymph nodes with regional and nonregional node location.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc34" name="refsrc34"/>34] </sup>This modification, which seemed to be simpler and to better predict long-term survival, was adopted into the revised system. </para>

        <para>Preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery is another option. However, the evidence for this approach is weak; the chance of increase in 2-year overall survival is less than 6%, compared with approximately 13% with trimodality therapy. </para>
        <para>Stage IV disease is treated with chemotherapy or symptomatic and supportive care, as indicated. For patients who, because of their clinical condition or owing to advanced disease, are not candidates for curative treatment, the goal of therapy is palliation of dysphagia, so that these patients can eat. No single method of palliation is best for every situation. Most patients require more than 1 kind of palliative treatment to sustain esophageal patency during the course of their disease. </para>

Shaheen et al reported complete eradication of all dysplasia 2 years after RFA in 101 of 106 patients (95%). After 3 years, dysplasia remained eradicated in more than 85% of patients, without maintenance RFA. The rate of serious adverse events was 3.4%, and the rate of esophageal stricture was 7.6%.<sup>[<ref_inline id="refsrc74" name="refsrc74"/>74] </sup></para>

        <title>Photodynamic therapy</title>
        <para>PDT involves the administration of photosensitizing chromophores, which are selectively retained by dysplastic malignant tissue. Light is then delivered in the area. The photosensitizer absorbs photons, becomes photoexcited, and transfers its energy to a chemical substrate that causes biologic damage to the abnormal tissue. A drawback of PDT is the formation of esophageal strictures in 34% of patients. The photosensitizer porfimer is FDA approved for ablation of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett esophagus. </para>

      <para>Chemotherapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, like squamous cell malignancies in general, is based on cisplatin. The chemotherapeutic choices in esophageal adenocarcinoma have been extrapolated from chemotherapy experience in patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Most of the chemotherapy regimens currently used for the treatment of esophageal cancer, including alkylating, antimetabolite, anthracycline, and antimicrotubular agents, have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </para>
